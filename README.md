This repository contains the necessary work undertaken to complete a project centered around Transport in Ireland.

The repository contains 2 folders "Report" and "Code files".

The Report folder contains the report (.docx) generated discussing the necessary data preparation, EDA, statistics and machine learning used for the project.

The Code files folder contains the jupyter notebook (.ipynb) with python code necessary to carry out various aspects of the project.

The outcome of the project was the generation of a highly accruate Random forest regressor machine learning model which could predict transport time, with this model compared against a number of other regression models.

Data was sourced from freely available transport datasets on Data.gov.
